# Lifestyle and Fitness Website

This website incorporates the creation of dynamic front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and EJS templates with the backend made using Node.js and Express.js. 

Features of the website include login/sign-up validation for which MongoDB is the database used, implementation of cookies to personalize the content, and data binding with angular JS. 

The website has a landing page that redirects to login or signup, a home-page which is accessed upon login, a nutrition page with a Body-Mass-Index (BMI) calculator and data binding, a fitness page, and a contact page that is linked to the database.

Running app.js (using > node app.js) and opening the browser to localhost:3000 will lead to the website.
